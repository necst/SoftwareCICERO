# Softcore CICERO

Software simulator for the [CICERO](https://github.com/necst/cicero) domain specific architecture.
This is a fork from [Valentina Sona](https://github.com/ValentinaSona) original [git repository](https://github.com/ValentinaSona/SoftwareCICERO)

## Build

To build the library and the example application, install CMake, Make and a C++ compiler

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# Optionally run tests
make test
```

## Run example

```bash
./build/cicero ./test/programs/1
```

## Use the library

Instantiate a CICERO object specifying:

1. **Character window (min 1, multichar only)**: number of active characters in the sliding window.
2. **Verbose setting (true/false)**: print execution information or match silently.

```cpp
#include "CiceroMulti.h"

auto CICERO = Cicero::CiceroMulti(1, true);
```

The simulator takes in input the program files compiled by [CICERO's compiler](https://github.com/necst/cicero_compiler).

Set the program (can be set multiple times in the object lifetime) and run the desired matches:

```cpp
CICERO.setProgram("program/to/run");

bool result = CICERO.match("RKMS");
bool result2 = CICERO.match("RACS");
```
